            {
                array_variable[i] = 'i';

 	     System.out.println(sum);
        } 
    }
a) 5
b) 6
c) 14
d) compilation error
View Answer

Answer: b
Explanation: Using comma operator, we can include more than one statement in the initialization and iteration portion of the for loop. Therefore both ++i and j = i + 1 is executed i gets the value – 0,1,2,3,4 & j gets the values -0,1,2,3,4,5.

          while(a<b)
          {
 
          System.out.println("Hello");

        }
    }
a) true
b) false
